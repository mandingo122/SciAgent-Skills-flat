# Scientific Critical Thinking: Evaluating Evidence and Claims

## Overview

Scientific critical thinking is the disciplined application of logical and methodological standards to evaluate whether a study's design, analysis, and interpretation support its conclusions. It is the skill that separates a researcher who synthesizes evidence from one who accumulates it. This guide covers the hierarchy of evidence, the mechanics of common biases, effect size interpretation, the p-value controversy, GRADE evidence grading, and common logical fallacies in the interpretation of scientific literature.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Study Design Hierarchy

Study designs vary in their ability to support causal inference. The hierarchy below applies to questions about the effect of an intervention or exposure on an outcome:

```
Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs (highest causal certainty)
    ↓
Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)
    ↓
Non-randomized controlled trials / cluster-randomized trials
    ↓
Prospective cohort studies (follow exposure → outcome forward in time)
    ↓
Retrospective cohort studies
    ↓
Case-control studies (compare exposed vs. unexposed given outcome)
    ↓
Cross-sectional studies (measure exposure and outcome simultaneously)
    ↓
Case series and case reports
    ↓
Expert opinion, mechanistic reasoning, animal models (lowest causal certainty)
```

**Important exceptions**: For questions about rare outcomes, case-control designs are often more efficient than cohort studies. For questions about diagnostic accuracy, randomized designs are usually inappropriate — cross-sectional or cohort designs with verified reference standards are preferred. For harm questions, RCTs are often infeasible (ethical constraints), making large cohort studies the best available evidence.

### 2. Effect Measures and Their Interpretation

Effect measures quantify the relationship between an exposure/intervention and an outcome. Confusing them is a leading source of misinterpretation.

| Measure | Formula | Use case | Key interpretation |
|---------|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **Risk Ratio (RR)** | Risk in exposed / Risk in unexposed | Cohort studies, RCTs | RR = 2.0: exposed group has twice the risk |
| **Odds Ratio (OR)** | Odds in exposed / Odds in unexposed | Case-control studies, logistic regression | Approximates RR when outcome is rare (<10%); overestimates RR for common outcomes |
| **Hazard Ratio (HR)** | Instantaneous event rate ratio | Survival analysis (Cox regression) | HR = 0.7: 30% lower hazard of event per time unit in treated group |
| **Number Needed to Treat (NNT)** | 1 / Absolute Risk Reduction | Clinical decision-making | NNT = 20: treat 20 patients to prevent 1 event |
| **Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR)** | Risk_control − Risk_treated | Clinical impact | ARR = 2%: intervention reduces absolute event rate by 2 percentage points |
| **Cohen's d** | (μ₁ − μ₂) / σ_pooled | Continuous outcomes, psychology | d = 0.2 small; 0.5 medium; 0.8 large |
| **Pearson r** | Correlation coefficient | Association, not causal | r = 0.1 small; 0.3 medium; 0.5 large (Cohen 1988) |

**Common error**: Reporting only the relative risk reduction (e.g., "50% reduction in risk") without the absolute risk reduction. A treatment that reduces risk from 2% to 1% has a 50% relative reduction but only 1% absolute reduction (NNT = 100). The relative measure appears more impressive but the absolute measure is clinically relevant.

### 3. Bias Types

Bias is systematic deviation of results or inferences from the truth. Unlike random error (reduced by larger samples), bias is directional and not correctable by increasing sample size.

**Selection bias**: Systematic difference in characteristics between those selected and not selected for study.
- *Examples*: Healthy worker effect (workers healthier than general population), loss to follow-up bias (sicker patients drop out), volunteer bias
- *Detection*: Compare baseline characteristics of included vs. excluded participants; assess attrition patterns

**Information bias**: Systematic error in measuring exposure or outcome.
- *Recall bias*: Cases remember exposure better than controls (especially case-control studies for rare diseases)
- *Observer bias*: Assessors aware of exposure status rate outcomes differently
- *Detection*: Look for blinding of outcome assessors; validated measurement instruments; objective vs. self-reported outcomes

**Confounding**: A variable associated with both the exposure and the outcome, creating a spurious or masked association.
- *Positive confounding*: Confounder inflates the observed association
- *Negative confounding*: Confounder masks a true association
- *Detection*: Compare crude and adjusted effect estimates; large change (>10%) indicates confounding
- *Control methods*: Randomization (RCTs), multivariable adjustment, propensity score methods, restriction, matching

**Reporting bias**: Selective reporting of outcomes or results based on their statistical significance or direction.
- *Publication bias*: Positive results are published; null results are not
- *Outcome reporting bias*: Predefined outcomes not reported if non-significant; unplanned analyses reported if significant
- *Detection*: Compare registered protocol vs. published outcomes; funnel plot asymmetry for meta-analyses

### 4. The P-value and Statistical vs. Clinical Significance

A p-value is the probability of observing results at least as extreme as those obtained, under the null hypothesis. It is NOT the probability that the null hypothesis is true, nor the probability that the finding is a false positive.

**Correct interpretation**: p < 0.05 means that, if the null hypothesis were true, fewer than 5% of equally designed studies would produce results this extreme or more. It does NOT indicate the effect is large, clinically meaningful, or replicable.

**Statistical significance ≠ clinical significance**: With large enough samples, even trivially small effects become statistically significant. A blood pressure drug that reduces systolic BP by 0.8 mmHg (95% CI 0.3–1.3, p = 0.001) is statistically significant but clinically irrelevant.

**Confidence intervals are more informative than p-values**: A 95% CI of [0.5 kg, 35 kg weight loss] and a 95% CI of [0.5 kg, 1.5 kg weight loss] can both have p < 0.05, but the clinical implications are vastly different. Always focus on CI width and range, not just whether it excludes the null.

### 5. GRADE Evidence Certainty

GRADE classifies the certainty of evidence across four levels:

| GRADE level | Meaning | Typical starting point |
|-------------|---------|----------------------|
| **High** | Further research very unlikely to change confidence | Consistent RCTs, large effect, no bias |
| **Moderate** | Further research likely to have important impact | RCTs with limitations, or strong consistent observational |
| **Low** | Further research very likely to have important impact | Observational studies, or RCTs with serious limitations |
| **Very low** | Any estimate is very uncertain | Case series, expert opinion, very inconsistent results |

GRADE certainty can be **downgraded** for: risk of bias, inconsistency (heterogeneity), indirectness (different population/outcome), imprecision (wide CI), and publication bias. It can be **upgraded** for: large effect (OR > 5), dose-response relationship, or all plausible confounders would reduce the effect.

## Decision Framework

```
How should I evaluate this study?
│
├── Step 1: What question is being answered?
│   ├── Intervention effectiveness → Need RCT or high-quality cohort
│   ├── Diagnostic accuracy → Need cross-sectional vs reference standard
│   ├── Prognosis → Need prospective cohort
│   └── Harm / rare exposure → Case-control or large cohort acceptable
│
├── Step 2: Is the study design appropriate?
│   ├── Design matches question → Proceed
│   └── Mismatch → Major limitation (flag)
│
├── Step 3: What are the key threats to validity?
│   ├── Selection bias → Who was included/excluded? Loss to follow-up?
│   ├── Information bias → Blinding? Validated instruments?
│   └── Confounding → What was adjusted for? Residual confounders?
│
├── Step 4: Are the effect estimates clinically meaningful?
│   ├── Effect size large enough to matter clinically?
│   ├── CI narrow enough to be informative?
│   └── Absolute vs relative risk reported?
│
└── Step 5: How certain is the evidence overall? (GRADE)
    ├── High certainty → Confident conclusion
    ├── Moderate certainty → Likely true; note limitations
    ├── Low certainty → Uncertain; more research needed
    └── Very low certainty → Cannot draw conclusions

| Claim type | Appropriate response | Red flags requiring skepticism |
|------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| "Drug X reduces mortality by 50%" | Ask: 50% relative or absolute? What was baseline risk? | Only relative risk reported; no CI provided |
| "Observational study shows cause" | Downgrade to "association"; list plausible confounders | Authors use "causes" without adjustment |
| "Significant p-value proves effect" | Check effect size and CI; assess clinical relevance | p = 0.04 with N = 50,000 and tiny effect |
| "Single RCT is definitive" | Check for replication; assess risk of bias | Funded by manufacturer; no blinding |
| "Preprint shows breakthrough" | Await peer review; check for reproducibility | No data/code sharing; sensational press release |
| "N-of-1 case report demonstrates treatment" | Note limited generalizability; no control | Used to support policy without cohort evidence |

## Best Practices

1. **Read the Methods before the Results**: The Discussion section is written by the authors to support their conclusions. The Methods section is where you independently assess whether the data can support those conclusions. Specifically: what were the pre-specified primary outcomes? Do the reported outcomes match those in the Methods or the registered protocol?

2. **Always seek the pre-registration record**: ClinicalTrials.gov, PROSPERO, and OSF registrations contain the original protocol. Comparing the pre-specified primary outcome to what was reported in the abstract is the single most efficient check for outcome reporting bias. A change in primary outcome without explanation is a major red flag.

3. **Distinguish statistical and clinical significance explicitly**: For every effect estimate, ask: if this effect is real, would it matter to a patient or a biological system? A genomic variant with OR = 1.05 (p = 1e-12) in a GWAS of 500,000 people is a genuine association but contributes negligibly to disease risk prediction.

4. **Identify the funding source and conflicts of interest**: Industry-funded trials are not automatically invalid, but industry funding is associated with more favorable outcomes for the sponsor's product. Assess whether conflicts are disclosed, whether the funder had access to data or participated in analysis, and whether an independent statistician reviewed the data.

5. **Check for multiple testing without correction**: When a paper tests 20 outcomes, 1 will be statistically significant at p < 0.05 by chance alone. Look for corrections (Bonferroni, Benjamini-Hochberg FDR) in genomics, proteomics, and other high-throughput studies. Absence of correction in a paper reporting 50 comparisons invalidates the significance claims.

6. **Require absolute risk data before accepting clinical conclusions**: For any binary outcome, request (or calculate) the absolute risk reduction (ARR) and number needed to treat (NNT) in addition to the relative risk. This applies to both journal articles and news coverage of medical research. ARR = Control_rate − Treatment_rate; NNT = 1/ARR.

7. **Apply structured critical appraisal checklists appropriate to study design**: CONSORT for RCTs, STROBE for observational studies, TRIPOD for prediction models, STARD for diagnostic accuracy, GRADE for certainty assessment. These checklists are available free from EQUATOR Network and identify every element required for a complete report.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Confusing association with causation in observational studies**: Observational studies identify associations, not causes. Coffee drinking is associated with reduced colorectal cancer risk — but coffee drinkers differ from non-drinkers in dozens of ways (diet, activity, socioeconomic status), any of which could explain the association.
   - *How to avoid*: Apply Bradford Hill criteria (strength, consistency, specificity, temporality, biological gradient, plausibility, coherence, experiment, analogy) to assess whether an observed association is likely causal. No single criterion is sufficient.

2. **Over-interpreting subgroup analyses**: Subgroup analyses in RCTs are almost always exploratory. A trial powered to detect an overall treatment effect cannot reliably detect subgroup-specific effects. Subgroup results are hypothesis-generating, not confirmatory.
   - *How to avoid*: Only trust pre-specified subgroup analyses conducted with formal tests of interaction (not just reporting significance within each subgroup separately). Post-hoc subgroup analyses reported without interaction tests should be treated as hypothesis-generating only.

3. **Accepting surrogate endpoints as equivalent to clinical endpoints**: A drug that improves an imaging biomarker (e.g., amyloid PET) does not necessarily improve clinical outcomes (e.g., cognitive function). The history of medicine is filled with interventions that improved surrogate markers and worsened or did not affect hard endpoints.
   - *How to avoid*: Ask whether the surrogate endpoint has been validated as a reliable predictor of the clinical endpoint in prior trials. If not, treat it as preliminary evidence only.

4. **Ignoring the healthy survivor / healthy adherer bias**: Patients who adhere to a treatment regimen tend to be healthier, more health-conscious, and have better outcomes even in the absence of a real treatment effect. This creates a spurious association between adherence and outcomes in observational data.
   - *How to avoid*: When evaluating observational studies of drug adherence or screening behavior, look for analyses comparing adherent groups across different interventions or using intention-to-treat principles.

5. **Anchoring on statistical significance and ignoring effect precision**: A single small study with p = 0.03 and a wide 95% CI (OR: 0.5 to 5.0) provides essentially no information — the true effect could be large harm or large benefit. The CI incompleteness makes the result uninterpretable.
   - *How to avoid*: Evaluate CI width alongside the p-value. A result is informative only when the CI excludes both no effect and clinically irrelevant effects. Very wide CIs signal underpowered studies.

6. **Treating p = 0.049 and p = 0.051 as fundamentally different**: The binary significant/non-significant threshold creates a cliff where results just below 0.05 are published and celebrated, while results just above are buried. This contributes to the replication crisis.
   - *How to avoid*: Interpret continuous p-values with context — p = 0.049 and p = 0.051 provide nearly identical evidence. Focus on effect size, CI, and consistency with prior evidence. Report exact p-values; avoid "statistically significant" language where possible.

7. **Dismissing animal and in vitro studies entirely, or accepting them uncritically**: Mechanistic studies in cells and animals are necessary for discovery but have high rates of failure in human translation. Approximately 85% of findings that replicate in animals fail in human clinical trials.
   - *How to avoid*: Weight animal/in vitro evidence as hypothesis-generating only. Ask whether the animal model is validated for the specific human condition; whether pharmacokinetic properties translate; and whether multiple independent labs have replicated the finding.

## Workflow

1. **Initial orientation (5 minutes)**
   - Read abstract; identify the study design
   - Check correspondence between Methods and Results sections for outcome consistency
   - Check for pre-registration (ClinicalTrials.gov, PROSPERO, OSF) and compare registered outcomes to reported outcomes

2. **Methods evaluation**
   - Assess appropriateness of study design for the research question
   - Identify inclusion/exclusion criteria and assess representativeness of the sample
   - Evaluate exposure/outcome measurement: objective vs. self-reported; validated instruments; blinding

3. **Results evaluation**
   - Extract primary outcome effect estimates with 95% CI and p-value
   - Calculate or request absolute risk data (ARR, NNT) if only relative measures reported
   - Assess whether confidence intervals are narrow enough to draw conclusions
   - Review confounding adjustment: were relevant confounders measured and included?

4. **Bias and quality assessment**
   - Apply appropriate structured tool (RoB 2, ROBINS-I, QUADAS-2, NOS)
   - Check for multiple testing; count the number of comparisons in the paper
   - Review funding source and conflicts of interest disclosures

5. **Conclusion and certainty rating**
   - Assign GRADE certainty (high/moderate/low/very low)
   - Write a 2–3 sentence summary: what the study found, how certain, what limitations apply
